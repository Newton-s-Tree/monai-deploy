# MONAI Deploy Helm Charts - Trigger New Jobs

## Download DICOM Datasets

In the last section, you have registered some sample workflows. It's now time to trigger some new jobs using those workflows.

First, download & unzip the following DICOM datasets and upload them to Orthanc.

- [Chest CT dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IGXUgZ7NQCwsix57cdSgr-iYErevqETO/view?usp=sharing)
- [Abdomen CT dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d8Scm3q-kHTqr_-KfnXH0rPnCgKld2Iy/view?usp=sharing)

### Upload DICOM Datasets

Navigate to Orthanc UI, and click *Upload* on the top right-hand corner.

Use the following command to locate the Orthanc service:

```bash
$ kubectl get svc orthanc

NAME      TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                        AGE
orthanc   NodePort   10.43.151.152   <none>        8042:27011/TCP,4242:8898/TCP   93m
```

The UI can be accessed via http://10.43.151.152:8042 or http://localhost:27011.

Drag & drop any DICOM files (no folders) to the blue box on the page and then click *Start the upload*.

Navigate to the home page and click *All studies* to confirm data's been uploaded.

### Triggering New Jobs

With the sample DICOM dataset uploaded to Orthanc, trigger a new job by navigating to *All studies* page and then
click on a study, from the menu on the left, click on *Send to DICOM modality* and then click on *MONAI-DEPOLOY*.

After a minute or two, depending on the size of the DICOM dataset, you may find the job listed in Argo.

Note: Check the **Archived Workflows** page if jobs cannot be found on the **Workflows** page.

Enable UI (http://localhost:2746) access with the following command to forward port 2476:

```bash
kubectl port-forward services/monai-deploy-argo-workflows-server 2746:2746
```
